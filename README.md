# Rainwater-Harvesting-Questionnaire
This is a form that includes a short questionnaire for customers who wish to install rainwater/ roofwater harvesting system in their house or at their property. The form will first collect the essential personal details of the customer and will then ask details required for installing appropriate water harvesting system at their facility. The purpose of the form is to collect preliminary information of the customer intended to install right water harvesting system at their household. Although, this is not the exact or complete structure of the form but could get a general idea of how the survey form should be to collect data for such activities and of course, to complete the given task of the project. The reason to choose this type of form is that, being a consultant in the water sector, I always wanted to take leverage of technology to solve daily water problems. Thus, apart from working on technical activities in the field, I am keen to develop tools that collects and disseminates useful information to end user. In my opinion, this is a step in that direction!
